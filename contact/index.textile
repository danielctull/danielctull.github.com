If you'd like to email me you can do so with the email address: dt (just my initials) at (you know, the @ sign) danieltull.co.uk. Hopefully this makes sense to you, but not the nasty spambots out there, though I guess they'll have had this programmed for too nowadays.
                       
Another way of getting my attention could be to mention me on "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com/danielctull.
