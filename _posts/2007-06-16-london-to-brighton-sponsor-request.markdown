title: London to Brighton sponsor request
---

My posts on this have been much more sparse than I had wanted to, due to not being able to train because of a bad ankle for two weeks, then the university work I had to do in the weeks after that.

So tomorrow is the big day. And I need your help. I have set up my online sponsor page at the British Heart Foundation site: <http://www.bhf.org.uk/sponsor/danieltull>. All donations go straight to the BHF, without me having to worry about collecting around and chasing people up. I do ask people to tick "gift aid" on the form, it won't cost you any more money, but it will make your donation worth 28p more for each £1 you donate. Stupid government taxing charities...

I'm looking to raise £100 and I have £45 so far, although I know a lot of people said they would sponsor, but haven't said an amount to put them down for. If you do sponsor me, leave a comment below so I know who you all are!
