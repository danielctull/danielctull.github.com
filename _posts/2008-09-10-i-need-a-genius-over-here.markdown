title: I need a Genius over here!
---

Aaah, iPhone OS 2.1; It brings speed increases, bug fixes and an increased battery life. After installing 2.1 on my first generation iPod touch, I also expected Genius to be everywhere and anywhere, but I found it nowhere.

Looking at the tutorial videos online, there should be a Genius button under the track position slider, but all I find is a big gapping hole:

<div class="pic">

</div>
At first I wasn't looking for the Genius function, and wondered why the hole was there, it looks completely ugly, especially as to how it was beforehand.

So I ask the question, where is my Genius?
