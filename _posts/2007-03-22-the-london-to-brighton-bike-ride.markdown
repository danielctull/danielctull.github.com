title: The London to Brighton Bike Ride
---

Just a quick post to say that today I received my pack for the [London to Brighton Bike Ride](https://www.bhf.org.uk/get_involved/take_part_in_our_events/bike_rides/london_to_brighton_bike_ride.aspx), a 54 mile bike ride from [Clapham Common to Brighton](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=Clapham+Common,+Clapham+Common+South+Side,+Lambeth,+London,+United+Kingdom&daddr=Brighton,+uk&layer=&ie=UTF8&sll=51.096195,-0.151285&sspn=0.926248,2.087402&z=9&ll=51.141448,-0.159302&spn=0.925349,2.087402&om=1) on the south coast of England. It takes place on the 15th June, so I have just under three months to train up for the event. It's a fifty-four mile ride and I've not done a ride of that length before. The longest I've done is around 25 to 30 miles going from Bognor Regis up to Goodwood and back.

I'll be in training for the next three months, and I'll be posting updates and tips on here. There is also the specific BHF tab where you can get the latest posts regarding the ride, and yes anything relating to the ride will be in that lovely red colour! I'll post about my fitness efforts soon, but be sure to leave a comment if you are the ride this year or if you've done in the past and have some tips for me!
