title: "After the London to Brighton Bike Ride"
---

Well, to be truthful, I don't ache as much as I thought I would. That's not to say it was easy, but it was a lot of fun. Rob and I enjoyed weaving through the traffic of bikes early on and throughout the morning. I'm definitely up for it again next year, where hopefully I can beat my time.

The time then. 54 miles and my ride time (the time I was actually pedalling) from my speedometer was 4 hours 15 minutes and 44 seconds, although in the real world it took me around 5 hours. I never envisioned the amount of people that would be there, which made the early sections longer than I thought they'd be. Seriously though, there were loads of people. I've never had to deal with riding with that many people before. I did encounter a family cycle day in Exeter once, but that was tiny when compared to this.

Thanks to all those who sponsored me, I should break the hundred pounds mark, which is awesome. Also, as ever, I've uploaded some photos. Some of them were taken by my Dad when he saw us about and by myself when we stopped.
