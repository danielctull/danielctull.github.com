title: Xcode 4 and Tabs vs Spaces
---

I've recently started on a project where the client's style guide requires me to use spaces instead of my usual tabs. This is only annoying when I forget to change the preference between when I work on my own stuff and theirs. However, today I found that you can set this preference on a per-project basis by opening up the file utility pane (that's the first tab in the right hand pane) while having the project selected in the file navigator.

The preference is store in the Xcode project file itself, so it's worth setting if there is a company policy on tabs vs spaces.
