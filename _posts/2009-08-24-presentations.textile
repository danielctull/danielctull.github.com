I am doing two talks over the next couple of weeks on the subject of iPhone development for the "righton iPhone Creators":http://groups.google.com/group/brighton-iphone-creators group and the "London iPhone Developer Group":http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1798655.

The first is in "Brighton at the Skiff at 7pm on Wednesday 26th August":http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4228762/?ps=5, titled <strong>Designing for the iPhone Developer</strong>. It's aimed at bringing into focus the information that an (iPhone) developer needs or should be asking for from a designer to complete a project in an efficient way.

The second is the following Wednesday (2nd September, again at 7pm) at the Apple Store on Regent Street, where I'll present an <strong>Introduction to Core Data</strong>. This will be the second evening hosted by the Apple Store, which gained a fantastic gathering of about 75 iPhone developer types last time, so hopefully we can pack out the seating area this time around.

I'll be posting the slides up here after the events, so if you can't come along but still want to see what I said, you can.
